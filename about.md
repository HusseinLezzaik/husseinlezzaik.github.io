I'm a software developer at [IBS Software](https://www.ibsplc.com/) on the Core team reporting to Chief Software Architect; building distributed systems, infrastructure, and platforms for crew scheduling [solvers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research) for airlines.

Previously, I've led the autonomous system navigation development at a robotics startup, and done fair amount of ML research during my undergrad and masters.

I got excited about neural networks in 2019 during an undergrad research internship training CycleGANs for audio generation at the American University of Beirut, and my master [thesis](https://github.com/HusseinLezzaik/Deep-Learning-for-Multi-Robotics) using Q-Learning for robotics motion planning at Inria and the University of Waterloo.

Beyond work, I do AI research for robot learning and locomotion at [xresearch.ai](https://xresearch.ai/).

I love solving deep technical problems ðŸ§ ðŸ¤–ðŸ’¥, and building startups that make our world a better place. I also [read](https://www.goodreads.com/husseinlezzaik) heavily, write, enjoy art, and love to [travel](https://www.youtube.com/@HusseinLezzaik/shorts) to new cities any time I have a chance.
