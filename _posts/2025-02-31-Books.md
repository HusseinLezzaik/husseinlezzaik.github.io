Given how cold the winter in Canada is, and my bucket list of places to visit in northern America has been completely cleared - I spent the entire month of February reading through books about technology, startups, finance, and scientific innovation.

I'd spend every waking non-working hour reading through books until midnight, and then ordering new books for the following day until I went through the list of books that I will share in this post.

My strategy in choosing what to read was to search for the biographies of the most innovative technology companies of the past fifty years, as well as books that are at the intersection of high value x fun.

Here's the entire bookshelf:

And here are the books in each shelf from bottom to top:

<img src="/assets/past/l2.jpeg" width="100%" />
<img src="/assets/past/l3.jpeg" width="100%" />
<img src="/assets/past/l4.jpeg" width="100%" />
<img src="/assets/past/l5.jpeg" width="100%" />

I hope this list of books inspires you to find an idea that impacts your career.
